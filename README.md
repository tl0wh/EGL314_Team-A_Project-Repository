## Overview
Project S.O.N.I.C (Sensory Observation Ninja Immersive Challenge) is an experiential/exploratory initiative designed to blend the ancient "ninja training techniques" with modern technologies. Students are to design a range of interactive stations that simulate ninja training scenarios, designed to test and enhance your listening abilities, reaction times and strategic thinking. The stations include:
1. Stealth Walking
2. **The Blindfold Challenge** (Team A)
3. Art Of Hearing
4. Reaction Training
5. Memory Sequence
6. Graduation Sequence
<p>
  In this repository, the focus will be strictly on Station 2 - Reaction Training.

## Station 2 - The Blindfold Challenge
The ‚ÄúBlindfold Challenge‚Äù, where your vision takes a 
backseat and your ears take the lead<br>
Participants are blindfolded and must navigate 
through a course guided solely by sounds.<br>
Participants must avoid contacting obstacles 
placed throughout the course for a successful 
attempt.<br>
