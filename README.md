## Overview
Project S.O.N.I.C (Sensory Observation Ninja Immersive Challenge) is an experiential/exploratory initiative designed to blend the ancient "ninja training techniques" with modern technologies. Students are to design a range of interactive stations that simulate ninja training scenarios, designed to test and enhance your listening abilities, reaction times and strategic thinking. The stations include:
1. Stealth Walking
2. **The Blindfold Challenge**
3. Art Of Hearing
4. Reaction Training
5. Memory Sequence
6. Graduation Sequence
<p>
  In this repository, the focus will be strictly on Station 4 - Reaction Training.
